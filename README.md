# Expense-Tracker
## The Expense Tracker is a program created for helping people tracking their personal expenses
 
#### Each expense has a `day` (integer between 1 and 30), `amount` of money (positive integer) and expense `type` (string). 

### The functionalities of the program are exemplified below:
1. Add an expense. Expense data is read from the console.
2. Display the list of expenses.
3. Filter the list so that it contains only expenses above a certain value read from the console.
4. Undo the last operation that modified program data. This step can be repeated.
